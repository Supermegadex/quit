<p><span class="mon">“Sans, w-what did you do?”</span> Alphys asked.</p>
<p><span class="sans">“ill explain later, alph”</span></p>
<p>“Did you just…teleport?”</p>
<p><span class="sans">“sure”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Okay, I’ll get started on the pie. Would anyone care to help?”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Coming Tori!”</span> Asgore said, trying not to seem too enthusiastic.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Heck yeah!”</span> Undyne shouted, definitely not hiding any of her excitement.</p>
<p><span class="pap">“Don’t cook without me!”</span></p>
<p>Asriel and Frisk came along, too, while Alphys, Grace, and Sans sat down and enjoyed some tea together. The two scientists were fascinated by each other’s details on how the two kinds of creatures worked, while Sans relaxed and listened.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand, though! If Asriel died centuries ago, how is he alive now?”</p>
<p><span class="mon">“I really don’t know, Grace. Uh, I have a few hypotheses, however.”</span></p>
<p>Frisk peered into the library from the kitchen before walking over to Alphys. Frisk whispered something to her while Asriel also exited the kitchen. Both children took a seat at the table.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“O-Oh. R-really? Um…G-Grace. W-well. I hadn’t even th-thought of that. M-maybe my experiments had a…good side?”</span></p>
<p>*CRASH!</p>
<p><span class="mon" id="ch8fire1">“Don’t worry!”</span> Toriel called. <span class="mon">“The pie is done and has been set out to cool.”</span></p>
<p>Papyrus, Undyne, and Asgore rushed out of the kitchen, Toriel close behind carrying the Butterscotch-Cinnamon Pie. When everyone was seated, Toriel stood up.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Shall we begin? I think we should start at the beginning, if that’s okay with you, Asriel and Frisk.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Okay then… well, when I died, Dad, my dust fell on your flower patch. My soul, with <span class="chara"></span>’s, disappeared like any monster’s. The next thing I remember; I have two memories for the same time. One was extremely vague… I can hardly recall it. The other was of me, in as a flower. I just… woke up without arms or legs; I don’t know why or how, but it was awful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Oh my god, Asriel! I am so sorry! I made you like that! It was a mistake. While I was working for your father, I was researching DETERMINATION and injected it into a flower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“There’s no need to be sorry. I’m fine now, aren’t I?”
<p><span class="mon">“And, Alphys, it’s thanks to you that Asriel is alive again. You should be proud of that! Anyway, everyone, I’ll pick up. The flower, a non-sentient object, needed sentience, or self-identification, to be able to contain DETERMNATION. Asriel’s dust, any monster dust, contains parts of the fallen person. That’s why you use it in funerals; I read about it. Anyway, the flower ‘became’ Asriel by taking on his person.”
<p><span class="mon">“Wait… so, this isn’t… Asriel?”</span> Toriel asked.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Hold on. We’re not there yet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“The flower, who gave himself the nickname ‘Flowey,’ could not feel emotions, as he was soulless. He found you both, Mom and Dad, and you helped him the best you could, but failed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“I couldn’t take it, and ended my existence… or, tried to. DETERMINATION is an incredibly strong power. What it does is alters the universe in favor of the determined in the form of saving, loading, and resetting. When I died, I loaded, back to my SAVE point… Dad’s garden.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon" id="ch8fire2">“Flowey used his powers for good at first; reset after reset, he found the ins and outs of everyone in the underground. But, because he didn’t feel compassion, he quickly became bored. He started to kill people. The interesting thing, though, is that the powers of DETERMINATION only work for the being with the highest concentration of it. When I fell into the Underground, my power vastly outweighed Flowey’s, and now I have the powers of DETERMINATION. Remember the flower that captured you all? That was Flowey. He absorbed your souls, and that power gave him the ability to take on his ‘real form’—Asriel. Now, to answer your question, Mom, this was not ‘really’ Asriel per-se. It was a flower who took on the persona, memories, and personality of him—an unnatural copy. But, remember, no one ever keeps the same body. We grow up; we change. What makes us ‘us’ is our personality, our <span class="chara"></span>cter, our soul. Because he has his soul, your one-hundred-per-cent real son, my brother is sitting right next to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Wow, Frisk. That… that makes me feel so much better.”</span> Sniffled Asriel.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Alphys, it’s because of you that we have Asriel back. If there hadn’t been a vessel for Asriel’s physicality, he wouldn’t be here, would he?”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“W-well, n-no. I suppose not!”</span> Alphys smiled.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“When Asriel assumed his ‘true’ form, using SOUL power, he attacked me and became the ‘God of Hyperdeath.’”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“I used to hear him and <span class="chara"></span> calling themselves things like that.”</span> Asgore added.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Y-yeah. Uh, I invented those moves a long time ago, for fun.”</span> Asriel smiled a very embarrassed smile.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Ha! Nice! Anyway, I awakened all of your souls in Asriel, where we worked together to remind him of the compassion he once again contained.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“I felt it, all of your souls beating as one. I felt how much hope you had, how much you loved Frisk. I broke the barrier with the power of the six human souls and all of the monsters’ souls. After that… after that… Mom, Dad, I was so afraid. I didn’t have s-soul inside m-me. I was g-going to be a f-flower again. I ran away to the r-ruins where <span class="chara"></span> was buried. I missed them. Well, I thought I did.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“I ran down to the ruins as fast as I could. I spoke with Asriel. I couldn’t think of a way to save him. Sans, forgive me: I reset.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sans">“i know.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Well, actually make that twenty times. I couldn’t let Asriel die. On that twentieth run, I told myself that I just had to do it. I took Asriel’s hand and brought him to Home. Asriel told me he needed to rest, but when I woke up, he had become Flowey again. I brought him up to you guys, and when you showed such great compassion toward him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“So I did see my soul…”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Yes. I absorbed it. <span class="chara"></span> and Asriel were both there. Asriel still believed <span class="chara"></span> was his best friend, but after a little talking, Asriel saw the truth: <span class="chara"></span> wasn’t such a good person.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“I guess I could never tell much about them…”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“I mean, I thought we got along just fine, but the more I recall it, I remember all the bad things they did. Like, they killed themselves on purpose.”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“What? Oh my god, Asriel!”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“I let them go. Frisk gave me my pure soul back. I am home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="pap">“WOWIE! THAT WAS A VERY INTERESTING STORY!”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Oh, Asriel, you told me there was someone else who helped you. Who was that, again?”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Uhm, I think his name was Aster or… Doctor Gaster maybe?”</span></p>
<p id="ch8fire3">Sans, who was pretending to sleep, stood up and opened his left eye.</p>
<p><span class="sans">“kid, are you looking for a bad time?”</span></p>
