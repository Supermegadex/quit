    <p>THAT LAST PART WAS A TEASER! Not a prank. There will be more of that to come, but I'm not done, yet!</p>
    <p>wOA! You...you read the first part of the story! Thanks! It's not even close to being finished, though (actually, I plan on continually writing this until I get bored of it, whereapon I will tie it up neatly).</p>
    <p>Here's the free-to-use version I promised: <a href="/story"><svg style="width:24px;height:24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path fill="#7bbff0" d="M6,2H14L20,8V20A2,2 0 0,1 18,22H6A2,2 0 0,1 4,20V4A2,2 0 0,1 6,2M13,3.5V9H18.5L13,3.5M7,13L8.5,20H10.5L12,17L13.5,20H15.5L17,13H18V11H14V13H15L14.1,17.2L13,15V15H11V15L9.9,17.2L9,13H10V11H6V13H7Z" />

<p>Also, big shout-out to Pate Mateus: a really cool babu who keeps me up at night. He's my inspiration.</p>

        <br>Anyway, I'll give you some contact info of mine, as long as you promise to follow some rules:
        <ol style="text-indent: 0;">
            <li>NO SPAM, PLEASE! If you so choose to clog my inbox, may you have a <span class="hint" onclick="Materialize.toast(bt, 18000)">bad time.</span>
            </li>
            <li>I appreciate constructive criticism! However, criticism without construction is unhelpful and therefore unwelcome.</li>
            <li>Ideas for the story? Send 'em in! I will not change anything about the AU's canon, though, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li>Like the story? Send me an email! Telling me I'm doing well is what keeps me motivated.</li>
        </ol>
        <a onclick="contact()">If you can handle this responsibility, click here!</a>
        <br>
        <h5><a href="" id="mail"></a></h5>
        <br><span class="message"></span>
        <div class="ooo red accent-1" style="border-radius: 2px; box-shadow: 0px 3px 5px rgba(0,0,0,.25); display: inline-block; padding-right:40px;">Can't wait to hear from you, <i><b><span class="chara" style="color:#ff1744"></span>!</b></i>

                <br>
                <hr>
                <br> I also have some questions for all readers:
                <ul>
                    <li>What do you think of the title? It's been redacted, but it's still here somewhere...</li>
                    <li>Do you think that I should spend my time on creating short, animated cutscenes?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Perhaps I should make this into a fully-playable game?!? I could do it, but it would take a LONG TIME!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br> Click above to show your responsibility, then shoot me an email! Or... I guess I have a tumblr too if you want that...
                <iframe frameborder="0" border="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true" height="20" width="200" src="https://platform.tumblr.com/v2/follow_button.html?type=follow-blog&amp;tumblelog=supermegadexter&amp;color=blue"></iframe>
                <br>I literally never use it for posting or reblogging, so it's completely empty. So, another question: should I start posting updates to tumblr?
                <br>Well, I also WILL BE REPLACING the regular, easy-to-read JS with obfuscated stuff so that secrets will be easier to hide >;) HOWEVER! This is still open source! To see the readable javascript, just visit my GitHub and look at the files that do not end with .ob.js!
                <br>Phew, these are a lot of words, are they not?

    <br> One more thing...(maybe): There's another document that is part of this project that I might release with enough
    <br><br><span style="opacity: .06; font-size: 15px;">It may also be worth noting that I really like Homestuck.</span>
