<p>As Frisk expected, the shattering of the barrier made world headlines. What did surprise them, though, was the fact that their biological parents showed up with authorities.</p>
<p>“We are searching for a ‘Frisk Moore.’” Said one of the men. “Her mother informed us that she climbed Mt. Ebott today.”</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Oh! I almost thought you were talking to me!”</span> Frisk giggled. <span class="mon"><i>Today! I climbed Mt. Ebott a week ago!</i> “My name is Frisk Dreemurr. Nice to meet you, sir!”</span></p>
<p>“There you are, Frisk!” They recoiled from their father. “What's wrong? Aren't you happy to see us?”</p>
<p><span class="mon">“I don't know who you are. I am Prince Frisk Dreemurr, and this is my brother, Prince Asriel of the Underground.”</span> They gestured toward Asriel and smiled.</p>
<p>“You don't have a brother! Especially not that scumbag!” their mother screeched.</p>
<p><span class="mon" id="ch6fire1">“What did you call my brother?” “What did you call me?” “What did you call our son?”</span> Frisk, Asriel, and Asgore and Toriel, respectively, asked. Rhetorically, of course.</p>
<p>“These beasts are nothing but dirty creatures without souls. Let's go, Frisk.” she responded.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“What? You're asking me to leave my family? Sorry, human, but you are mistaken. I am a monster; remember that monsters have many different forms. Also, all monsters have souls. I can prove that.”</span> Frisk held out their bright red soul for the woman to see, while Asriel, Asgore, Toriel, Undyne, Alphys, Sans, and Papyrus did the same.</p>
<p>“I'll be damned,” said Frisk's father. “It doesn't matter, though. Come with us, girl! According to the laws of the United States of America--”</p>
<p><span class="mon">“No! You are NOT my father, I am NOT a girl, and we are NOT in the United States!"</span> Frisk snapped. <span class="mon">“My father is Asgore Dreemurr, my mother is Toriel Dreemurr, I have a brother named Asriel Dreemurr, I do not associate with a gender, we are in the Underground, and you must not have heard me: my name is FRISK DREEMURR!"</span></p>
<p>"Well, you match the photographic identification exactly. Frisk, you will come with us, now. We will also set up an appointment with a psychiatrist. That is not your real family. you must have experienced some kind of trauma—whoa!" The man was flung off of Frisk and more men tried to grasp them. He had used a swab to grab some skin off of Frisk.</p>
<p>Quickly, Frisk formed a barrier between them and the men. They then held up a magical fireball, impossible for a human.</p>
<p><span class="mon">"I am very proud, Frisk; you are an extraordinary monster."</span> Toriel fought to hold back tears.</p>
<p><span class="pap">"GO, FRISK! YOU ARE GREAT!"</span> called Papyrus.</p>
<p><span class="sans">"goat get 'em, kid."</span></p>
<p>The paparazzi fled the Underground in horror, leaving only child authorities and Frisk's parents. Frisk extinguished the flame.</p>
<p><span class="mon">"Like I said, you're not my parents. You may have been Frisk Moore’s parents, but because you abused them, made them do those terrible things, they had the DETERMINATION to separate from your wretched family. The name 'Moore' has no meaning anymore. As you can see, I am using magic, a skill only monsters can use; I’m a monster. Stop trying to get me back so that I can become your slave again. You don't love anyone at all"</span></p>
<p>"But, Frisk, we DO love you!"</p>
<p>Frisk began to tear up. A noticeable shaking in their voice worried Toriel. <span class="mon">“You sat around ALL DAY while I cleaned, made you food, bought you beer and wine, and was forced to 'relieve' you! I never got an education or any affection. Authorities, check the records of every school district; ‘Frisk Moore’ didn't go anywhere! In fact, I learned more from my mother than I ever did before I climbed Ebott."</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">"I'm flattered!"</span> Toriel bent down and embraced Frisk.</p>
<p>"I would ask you, 'is this true, ma'am?' but you'd say 'no' anyway, so we'll just run a full report." one man said.</p>
<p>Someone came running in. "DNA tests negative. Were you adopted, Frisk?"</p>
<p><span class="mon"><i>Oh. Interesting...</i> “All I know is that this is my family, royalty of the Underground. They didn't adopt me. Alphys, is there a test we can run similar to that of human DNA testing?"</span></p>
<p>"That won't be necessary," Frisk's biological (?) father quickly interrupted, "She's our daughter, and she'll be coming home with us. Hurry up, Frisk!"</p>
<p id="ch6fire2">"No, they won't yet." A tall woman in a lab coat sporting a menacing glare entered the cavern. She spun around to face Alphys. "so, your name is Alphys. I'm Professor Grace, nice to meet you! Let's do this test that Frisk suggested, hm?" Her spooky look transformed into a friendly smile as she shook Alphys's hand.</p>
<p><span class="mon">"N-nice to m-m-meet you…t-too? Th-this way, G-Grace, to my l-l-lab."</span></p>
<p>She hurried off toward Hotland. Grace jogged along with her.</p>
<p>"You don't need to be nervous around me Alphys! I want to HELP Frisk. I actually witnessed what their parents did years ago.”</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Why don’t you j-just say s-say that?”</span></p>
<p>“I think this test may prove more than what one voice could say. Again, though, you don’t have to be afraid of me. Why are you stuttering?”</p>
<p>Frisk tugged on Grace’s shirt and whispered, <span class="mon">“She did some horrible things, Ms. Grace. Not on purpose, but she did them, and she hates it. Don't mention it anymore because she's just starting to get her confidence back.”</span></p>
<p>“Of course,” she said to the child, then turned to Alphys. “Can you explain this monster identification test to me?”</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Y-yes. You see, a monster’s body is comprised primarily of magic, whereas humans are composed of cells and water. Because a monster’s SOUL is completely connected with the body, it is easy to run tests on it without hurting anything, and procreation is done by creating a brand-new soul--parents of a monster use part of their soul when they have a child. It can be regenerated in a few weeks through regular nutrition, though, so it doesn’t actually harm anyone. Using two permanent imprints on the soul left from creation, we can trace a monster’s SOUL to the ones that created it.”</span></p>
<p>“Wow! How interesting! I have much to learn from you, Alphys.”</p>
<p>Alphys smiled, clearly happy that someone cared about her work so much.</p>
