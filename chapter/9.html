    <p>WOA! You...you read my story! Thanks! It's not even close to being finished, though (actually, I plan on continually writing this until I get bored of it, whereapon I will tie it up neatly). The non-interactive, free-to-use version is available on <a href="http://1drv.ms/1R2qhtn">OneDrive.</a>

        <br>Anyway, I'll give you some contact info of mine, as long as you promise to follow some rules:
        <ol style="text-indent: 0;">
            <li>NO SPAM, PLEASE! If you so choose to clog my inbox, may you have a <span class="hint" onclick="Materialize.toast(bt, 18000)">bad time.</span>
            </li>
            <li>I appreciate constructive criticism! However, criticism without construction is unhelpful and therefore unwelcome.</li>
            <li>Ideas for the story? Send 'em in! I will not change anything about the AU's canon, though, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li>Like the story? Send me an email! Telling me I'm doing well is what keeps me motivated.</li>
        </ol>
        <a onclick="contact()">If you can handle this responsibility, click here!</a>

                <hr>
                <br> I also have some questions for all readers:
                <ul>
                    <li>What do you think of the title? (No, it is NOT [[REDACTED]]! Do you really think I would be so cliché? Go ahead; try to find the REAL title! It's here somewhere...) I am using [[REDACTED]] as a placeholder while I perfect the title.</li>
                    <li>Do you think that I should spend my time on creating short, animated cutscenes?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Perhaps I should make this into a fully-playable game?!? I could do it, but it would take a LONG TIME!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br> Click above to show your responsibility, then shoot me an email! Or... I guess I have a tumblr too if you want that...
                <iframe frameborder="0" border="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true" height="20" width="200" src="https://platform.tumblr.com/v2/follow_button.html?type=follow-blog&amp;tumblelog=supermegadexter&amp;color=blue"></iframe>
                <br> I literally never use it for posting or reblogging, so it's completely empty. So, another question: should I start posting updates to tumblr?
                <br> Well, I also WILL BE REPLACING the regular, easy-to-read JS with obfuscated stuff so that secrets will be easier to hide >;) HOWEVER! This is still open source! To see the readable javascript, just visit my GitHub and look at the files that do not end with .ob.js!
                <br>Phew, these are a lot of words, are they not?
                <br>
                <hr>
                <br> One more thing...(maybe): There is a OC, OP, and Story Arc document that I may or may not release later (.
