<p>Whoa! You...you read my story! Thanks! It's not even close to being finished, though (actually, I plan on continually writing this until I get bored of it, whereapon I will tie it up neatly).
<br>Anyway, I'll give you some contact info of mine, as long as you promise to follow some rules:
<ol style="text-indent: 0;">
    <li>NO SPAM, PLEASE! If you so choose to clog my inbox, may you have a <span class="hint" onclick="Materialize.toast(bt, 18000)">bad time.</span></li>
    <li>I appreciate constructive criticism! However, criticism without construction is unhelpful and therefore unwelcome.</li>
    <li>Ideas for the story? Send 'em in! I will not change anything about the AU's canon, though, so keep that in mind.</li>
    <li>Like the story? Send me an email! Telling me I'm doing well is what keeps me motivated.</li>
</ol>
<a onclick="contact()">If you think you can handle these rules, click here!</a>
<br><h5><a href="" id="mail"></a></h5><br><span class="message"></span><br><br><br><div class="ooo">Can't wait to hear from you, <i><b><span class="chara"></span>!</b></i></div><br>&nbsp;

    $(function(){
        $(".ooo").hide();

    function contact(){
        var mail = document.querySelector("#mail");
        mail.innerText="delpino the dragon 1 at hotmail";
        mail.href="mailto:delpinothedragon1@hotmail.com";
        $(".message").html("Ha! See what I did there? You can't copy-and-paste it! (You can actually just click on it, though)");
        $(".chara").smoothScroll();
        $(".ooo").fadeIn();
        chS[0].fire();
    }
    /* global $Aud chS */
