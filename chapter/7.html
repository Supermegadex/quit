<p>In the lab, Frisk presented their SOUL to Alphys for inspection. After a few mechanical whirrs, the massive display in front of Frisk, which had been used to stalk them through the underground, showed two strings of text. The reptilian scientist walked up to the screen and pointed to these strings, more than excitedly.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Those are SOUL identification strings. I wrote an algorithm that is able to make a unique string for each soul, using the conscious data marked with a unique print flowing from them.”</span> Alphys looked proud. <span class="mon">“This is a breakthrough for not only Frisk, but monsterkind! <span class="hint" onclick="Materialize.toast('Yes, it is AU canon that Frisk has ACTUALLY become a monster.', 4000)">Frisk, not only are you really a monster, but those strings identify the SOULS of Asgore and Toriel!</span>”</span></p>
<p>Frisk made an expression that looked surprised, relieved, and ecstatic at the same time.</p>
<p><span class="mon" id="ch7fire1">“How, Frisk?”</span> Asgore asked before he and Toriel fell on their knees and squeezed Frisk gently.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Our children! Let us discuss what has happened over pie. I have so many questions!”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“So, uh…you’re my real sibling, huh? That’s AWESOME! I love you so much!”</span></p>
<p>Asriel quickly joined the party, as did all the other monsters and Grace.</p>
<p>“Mr. and Mrs. Moore, you are under arrest for attempted kidnapping, child abuse, and other various crimes.”</p>
<p>“What? But you don’t even have any evidence against us! I don’t understand how you could believe such a vile creature! Look at her! She looks like she’s going to kill someone!”</p>
<p>Alphys just smiled as the man and woman were dragged away.</p>
<p>Undyne walked over to Alphys and smooched her right on the lips.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Nice work, nerd!”</span> she said as her huge cheeky smile took over her face. Alphys turned an incredibly deep shade of crimson. <span class="mon">“Now we've got another member of the family!"</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Everyone, mom made a suggestion. Let’s go Home and have some B-scotch pie!”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“B-scotch pie, Tori?”</span> Asgore’s mouth hung open, drooling.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Don’t ‘Tori’ me, Asgore! Well, not now…”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Asgore’s been trying to perfect that recipe for years! Do you think you could teach both of us how to make it, Toriel?”</span> Undyne asked.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Indeed. Let us make our way to the ruins, as all of the ingredients are already there.”</span></p>
