<p>A red heart flew above the heads of the monsters. As if not governed by the laws of inertia, it instantly stopped in midair and exploded into thousands of pieces.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Frisk!”</span> Undyne called. <span class="mon">“What's going on?”</span></p>
<p>A white light momentarily blinded the friends.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“T-the f-fl-flower! I-it's gone!”</span> Alphys cried.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Frisk, do you have an explanation for…”</span></p>
<p id="ch5fire1">Toriel was unable to finish as a pure white SOUL flew across the room into a little fluffy monster whose arms encircled an innocent-looking child donning a striped shirt. The two children let go of each other and turned to face Frisk's friends.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Oh my…"</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Everyone, this is…”</span> Frisk began.</p>
<p><span class="sans">“yeah. we know, kid. or, at least i do. you're the prince, ain'tcha?”</span></p>
<p><span class="pap">“WOWIE! ANOTHER ASGORE CLONE! WHO KNEW ASGORE WAS POPULAR ENOUGH TO BE CLONED SO MUCH!”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“Yes, yes I am, Sans,”</span> replied Asriel. <span class="mon">“For those who don't already know, howdy! My name is Asriel Dreemurr. Uh, not my dad’s clone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="pap">“OH! WELL, THAT’S A LETDOWN…”</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“My child!”</span> exclaimed Toriel and Asgore in unison, who both ran to give Asriel the biggest hug of his life. Frisk joined as well.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Dreemurr Family hug!”</span> Frisk playfully shouted. <span class="mon"><i>This is the best day of my life!</i></span></p>
