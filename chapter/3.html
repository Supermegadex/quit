<p><span class="mon">“Alright, everyone, let's go!"</span> said Frisk quickly so that their friends wouldn't have time to notice that the flower he was holding had a face. They wanted to get to the surface first and make plans there.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Uhhh... Uhhh..."</span> Alphys attempted but was cut short by Frisk.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Not now, Alphys! We shall go forth and enjoy the splendor of the world ahead!"</span> Frisk said in the Torielesque tone he could.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Child, you needn't speak in such a way, for you are very young,"</span> Toriel half-scolded.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“Come on, mom!"</span></p>
<p><span class="mon">“MOM!"</span> screamed the flower. Frisk held him tight.</p>
<p><span class="mon">“What?"</span> questioned Toriel. <span class="mon">“Are you okay, little flower?”</span></p>
<p>Everyone gathered close and looked at Flowey. The yellow plant started crying. Soon enough, the pot started to overflow. As their friends (except for Alphys) showed compassion toward the little plant, Frisk's DETERMINATION grew. Beings needed a SOUL to feel happiness, right? They had a plan.
<p><span class="mon">"Uhh…Uhhhh…"</span> Alphys tried again, eyes wide in horror as the memories flooded her head.</p>
<p><span class="pap">"OH MY GOD! THAT'S THE FLOWER THAT LIKES ME SO MUCH!"</span> Sans looked at Papyrus, worried.</p>
<p><span class="mon" id="ch3fire1">"No…this is all a dream,"</span> Alphys said.</p>
<p><span class="mon">"No, Alphys, it's not. But don't worry; none of you worry! It's not going to hurt you! It's crying! Show some sympathy. Come on! Let's make this flower happy!"</span> Frisk cheered the monsters on as they showed compassion toward the creature.</p>
<p>Encouragement; kind words; a struggled, somewhat creepy caresses from Alphys; and shouting from Papyrus (<span class="pap">NYEH!</span>) all were thrown at Flowey, and he remembered what the emotions felt like. It was strange; a tingling was emanating from his body similar to what he felt while he was absorbing the souls of the Underground. Looking up, he saw a grey-and-red heart glowing into existence. Before Flowey could do anything, though, it was gone. Depressed, the plant cried even harder, unable to understand the sad truth of his existence.</p>
<p id="ch3fire2">While everyone was paying attention to Flowey, Frisk had backed off. While they were expecting something, hoping anything would happen, they were not expecting Asriel's very SOUL to just show up. Before thinking of any consequences, Frisk absorbed the SOUL.</p>
